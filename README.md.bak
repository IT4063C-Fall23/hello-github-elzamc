- 1️⃣ DO NOT TOUCH THIS DIRECTORY. This is what makes your folder a git repo.
- 2️⃣ This directory contains some supporting files for helpful extensions, and VSCode settings 
- 3️⃣ Another git related files. This tells git not to track certain files and folders that you don't want being uploaded
- 4️⃣ That's where the party is. You'll only be working in this file.
- 5️⃣ Some automated tests and checks
- 6️⃣ The README file (this right here)
- 7️⃣ The dependencies needed for this project. Actually deps and deps of deps, ...etc.
